        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Currently a coding student at <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a>, I'm a retail manager with a background in art, dreaming of a career change. I'm a Portland transplant from the South, and I love traveling, hiking, and backpacking. I've lived in California, southern Nevada, Tennessee, North Carolina, and now Portland!</p>
        <p>When I'm not studying or working, I enjoy being in nature, playing video games, running, and reading. I love to plan trips to National Parks and hope to transition to a job that makes it easier for me to travel.</p>

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>These projects are currently in-progress while I acquire programming skills and tools! Some projects from my first two weeks of coding school:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>"Izzy's First Webpage"</p>
          <img src="img/izzy-page-thumbnail.jpg" alt="thumbnail of pet website">
          <p>This webpage was created during my third day of class at Epicodus! It was based on an assignment for practicing inline-elements in HTML, specifically image tags. I added CSS the next week for independent practice.</p>
