        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Currently a coding student at <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a>, I'm a retail manager with a background in art, dreaming of a career change. I'm a Portland transplant from the South, and I love traveling, hiking, and backpacking. I've lived in California, southern Nevada, Tennessee, North Carolina, and now Portland!</p>
        <p>When I'm not studying or working, I enjoy being in nature, playing video games, running, and reading. I love to plan trips to National Parks and hope to transition to a job that makes it easier for me to travel.</p>

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>These projects are currently in-progress while I acquire programming skills and tools! Some projects from my first two weeks of coding school:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><a href="https://danis91.github.io/izzy-page/">"Izzy's First Webpage"</a></p>
          <p>This webpage was created using HTML and CSS, during my first day of class at Epicodus! It was based on an assignment for practicing inline-elements in HTML, specifically image tags.It serves as a simple page about my dog, Izzy. I plan on adding to it with Bootstrap and maybe even Javascript!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><a href="https://danis91.github.io/favorite-places/">"My Favorite Places"</a></p>
          <p>This webpage was created using HTML and CSS, during my second day of class at Epicodus! It was based on an assignment for practicing text styling with CSS. I added the curved image corners with the help of my partner during pair-programming. I hope to add elements to the page as I learn!</p>
